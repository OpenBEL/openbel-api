support: "Cationic amphiphilic drugs such as amiodarone, perhexiline, diethylaminoethoxyhexestrol (DEAEH) and tamoxifen can be first protonated in the intermembrane space of mitochondria, and then electrophoretically transported into the mitochondrial matrix thanks to the Δψm [3,4,40,42], as discussed in greater detail below. This transfer across the inner mitochondrial membrane dissipates Δψm (Figure 1) and increases the basal (state 4) mitochondrial respiration. This phenomenon, which is called 'OXPHOS uncoupling', can also be observed in the case of some mitochondrial poisons such as the protonophores 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) and carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP).",
